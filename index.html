            I am Esraa Abu Hana and I'm a civil engineer,I've graduated two years ago from YU.
            An ordinary Jordanian girl who lives in Irbid as a global citizen.
            I am fluent speaker Arabic and English, and beginner at Korean and Chinese languages.

            I have many interests including: green technology, artificial intelligence,and data science.
            I worked as a freelancer. Once you find me doing some designs in both of constructional or creative fields,
            whether using construction software such as Autocad, SAFE, ETABS, or manually.
            Sometimes I spend my time in making an archive or spreadsheet for some initiatives or agencies,
            and also you could find me teaching some sciences such as mathematics or chemistry.
            Because of that I have various experiences in the field of management, mathematics and statistics, data
            analysis ,
            or designing even drawing.
            In the past two years, the whole world and our society in particular, have faced many obstacles and
            problems.
            The last of them is the COVID-19 epidemic that has not ended yet.
            These reasons prompted me to think and find some solutions to help and make a difference.
            The common thing is that every time I tried to find a solution ,or create an idea for a project;
            It was based on software development.
            This is what I am interested in recently, so I aspire to become a professional software developer;
            to be able to merge my interests and convert what is going on in my head into practical and applicable
            solutions on the reayality.
